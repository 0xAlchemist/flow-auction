# Flow Auction Contract

A composable auction contract with a custom fungible and non-fungible token for testing. Both tokens conform to the token standards found in the Flow repo: [FT](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft/blob/master/contracts/FungibleToken.cdc) | [NFT](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/blob/master/contracts/NonFungibleToken.cdc)

## Deployment

This demo is currently available for download and deployment with the Flow CLI and VS Code Extension

## Account Setup (Outdated / WIP)

1. Send `transactions/setup/setup_account_1.cdc` with `account 1` selected as the signer
    - This transaction:
        - publishes a reference to the signer's DemoToken Vault
        - creates and stores a new NFT Collection
        - publishes a reference to the new NFT Collection
2. Send `transactions/setup/setup_account_2.cdc` with `account 2` selected as the signer
    - This transaction:
        - creates an stores an empty DemoToken Vault
        - publishes separate references to the vault Receiver and Balance interfaces
        - mints a new NFT (ID: 1) and deposits it into `account 1`'s NFT Collection
3. Send `transactions/setup/setup_account_1_tx_minting.cdc` with `account 1` selected as the signer
    - This transaction:
        - creates a new DemoToken minter with an allowedAmount of 1000
        - mints and deposits 40 DemoTokens into `account 1`'s Vault
        - mints and deposits 20 DemoTokens into `account 2`'s Vault
4. Send `transactions/setup/setup_account_3_and_4.cdc` with `account 3` and `account 4` selected as the signer
    - This transaction:
        - creates an stores an empty DemoToken Vault
        - publishes separate references to the vault Receiver and Balance interfaces 
5. Run `scripts/check_setup.cdc` to check the account balances are correct
    - `account 1` should have 100 DemoTokens and 10 NFT 
    - `account 2, 3, 4` should have 200 DemoTokens and no NFTs

Example `scripts/check_setup.cdc` response:

```bash
DEBU[0782] LOG [5175e9] "Account 1 DemoToken Balance:"

```bash
DEBU[0866] LOG [4a2468] "Account 1 NFTs in the auction queue"
